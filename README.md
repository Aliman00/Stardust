# Stardust SWG: Based on SWGEmu Core3 / Engine3 #

## What is SWGEmu? ##

Star Wars Galaxies was a massively multi-player online role playing game introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in the year 2003 and shut down in 2011.
It is this game the SWGEmu project focuses to recreate at a specific milestone referred to as Pre-CU, or Pre-Combat Upgrade. The Combat Upgrade was a set of game changes which radically changed the game-play, to the dislike of thousands of players. These changes led to the founding of this project, in an attempt to "recreate" the game as it was during the Pre-CU era.
At SWGEmu, Emulator refers to the software the SWGEmu team is building. This Emulator is meant to imitate Sony Online Entertainment's server-side software, which hosted the galaxies of Star Wars Galaxies during the Pre-CU era.
